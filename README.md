# Inventory

Recently, I started reading Implementing Domain Driven Design by
Vaughn Vernon. While there are useful code examples that accompany
the text, it is easier for me to learn the concepts through application.
As such, I created this repository to be a basic project
where I could apply the principles of Domain Driven Design.

This project serves as a simplistic inventory application where
users can manage a list of products, receive shipments, perform 
inventory on those products, and generate reports on the usage between 
two inventory periods.

The project tries to be agnostic of any frameworks and focus on DDD principles.
